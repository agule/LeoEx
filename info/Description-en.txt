This is a simple App to display trains timetable between the city of Rome and international airport Fiumicino [FCO].

Find Next scrolls the list to next train departure; times are displayed in Rome time zone regardless of your device settings.

It's initial alpha version, App will develop fast; please send your feedback on which function you need sooner.

Cheers!
